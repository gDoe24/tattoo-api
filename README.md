# Tattoo Shop Api

The Tattoo Shop API makes it easier for clients and tattoo artists to set up appointments. Use endpoints to manage artists, clients and appointments from creating, to updating to deletion. No more writing down schedules in some flimsy notebook which gets misplaced at the end of the day!

### Backend Setup

Follow the README.md in the backend folder to follow instructions on setting up the local environment along with project endpoints.
